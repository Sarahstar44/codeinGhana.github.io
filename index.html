      <p>You may be knowing your A’s and B’s and C’s, but are you educated or just literate? No rolling your eyeballs please, there is a difference. Literacy is knowing how to read and write. Education is to be able to reason, to use your ability to read and write to your benefit and to be able to gain your spectrum of knowledge by trying to surge deeper into the literate knowledge imparted to you.
